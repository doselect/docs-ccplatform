## Script (Algorithmic/API)

Each problem should contain the following information:

### Problem name
Some fancy name for the problem. If the problems are part of a hackathon/problemset, the name should go along with the theme of the hackathon/problemset.

### Problem statement
This explains the problem. The problem description should be interesting and easy to follow.

### Input format
The description of input for the problem.

### Output format
The desired format in which the script has to display the output.

### Limits
Limits for all the variables.

### Sample test cases
Sample input test cases which will give better understanding. Include image(s) if it can be better explained using them.

#### Input
input for first sample testcase
#### Output
output for first sample testcase
#### Explanation
explanation for first sample testcase

### Editorial
Explanation of solution to the problem. Include image(s) if it can better explained using them.

### Solution
The solution code in any accepted language. Make sure to add comments for better understanding.

### Difficulty of the problem
One of the following

* **Easy:** This kind of problem should be easily solvable by anyone who is familiar with basic data structures and algorithms. The approach for the solution should be obvious from the problem statement.
**Success rate:** 80%
* **Medium:** This kind of problem should require knowledge of advanced data structures and algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms, Graph traversal, etc.
**Success rate:** 50%
* **Hard:** This kind of problem should require experience in competitive programming along with knowledge of advance programming concepts.
**Success rate:** 20%

### Tags
Math, String manipulation, Graph, Dynamic programming, API, etc.

### Time limit
Approximate time limit for your submitted solution. The time limit for other languages will be automatically calculated relative to it.

### Test Cases
For each test case, you need to provide the following:
* **Input file:** The input which will be passed to the script.
* **Output file:** The desired output for the corresponding input.
* **Score:** The score for the particular test case
* **Penalty:** The penalty for the particular test case. For most of the cases, just leave it to 0.
* **Description:** It should specify what condition it tests.
* **Input file generator** The generator code used to make the input file. If using random in test case generator, make sure to use fixed seed.

## Guidelines for creating a new problem

* Try to base the problem on some practical use cases so that it becomes interesting and candidates get to learn something new in the process.
* The problem should not be copied from other websites.
* The solution should not be easily available on the internet.
* The problem statement should be written in simple language so that there is no ambiguity.
* Test cases should cover all corner cases so that the accepted solutions are indeed the correct ones.
* Test cases should contain easy test cases also so that users can get partial score for their attempt.
* Include image(s) if you think the problem can be better explained using them.
