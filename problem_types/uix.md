### Testcases
Testcases are programs which will be used to evaluate developer's submissions. You have freedom to write the testcases in `python 2`, `python 3` or `R`. The correctness of solution is determined by the exit status of the evaluation code. Evaluation code should exit with `zero` only if the submission is correct.
